                        <li>1. Write down what you can and cannot control. Fear and anxiety are natural responses to the unknown. Journal your thoughts and see what are the things you can change and what are those you can’t. For example, we can’t confront every person who doesn’t cover their mouths when they cough or sneeze, but we can walk away from them and keep a safe distance.</li><br/>
                        <li>2. Do not skip your medical appointments. Consult your doctor to see if your appointments can be rearranged; whether it’s possible to meet less frequently, or if there are other ways to have your sessions without meeting physically. Another way to minimise exposure each time you visit the hospital or clinic is to align your medical appointments on one day if possible, or have them less frequently according to your doctor’s advice.</li>
                        <li><br/>
                        3. Limit your exposure to media and yes, that includes muting family chat groups that spread well-meaning but also fear-mongering fake news. Get your information from reputable sources, be updated once or twice a day, and then fill the rest of your day with other meaningful activities.
                        </li><br/>
                        <li>4. Social distancing does not mean social isolation. Reach out and check in regularly with people you care about. Make that phone call, or even video calls using Facetime and Skype. Or send a text or whatsapp. Be part of social media community groups.</li><br/>
<li>5. If you or the person with COVID-19 experiences emergency warning signs, medical attention is needed immediately. Call 911 or your local emergency number if the sick person can't be woken up or you notice any emergency signs.</li><br/>
<li>6. Stay isolated in one room, away from your family and other people, as much as possible. This includes eating in your room. Open windows to keep air circulating. Use a separate bathroom, if possible.</li><br/>
<li>7. Avoid sharing personal household items, such as dishes, towels, bedding and electronics.
Wear a face mask when near others. Change the face mask each day.</li>
